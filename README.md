# access-control-benchmark

Running this code would require:

- MySQL to be installed and running,
- an abac, rbac, and pbac database to exist with the correct tables (see ER diagram),
- TPC-H data to be generated and loaded into a MySQL database titled "business"

policies.py should be ran first if you want to execute queries with access control.
